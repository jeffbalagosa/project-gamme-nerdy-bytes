Today, our team at NedyBytes underwent a project review with our instructor, Paul, after Jeff presented our wireframe design and our api endpoints. We received commendation for our progress and some feedback for minor improvements. Our team successfully identified and addressed issues in the code related to chat room and message creation where we have to change to endpoint path.

During the previous week, I was able to complete a backend code to get a cookie after logging the user in. We also established tables for cards, options, messages, and chat rooms. Additionally, we implemented endpoints for post card, post option, and view deck functionalities, all of which are secured by login authorization.

This week, we focused on enhancing our project's front-end functionality. Key achievements include the creation of a login page and navbar, providing a polished user interface. We added critical endpoints for retrieving all messages and user data. Also, we have a successful implementation of real-time polling, allowing messages for a specific user to be fetched every second. This dynamic feature enhances the responsiveness of our application. Lastly, we achieved the deployment of our project's backend and database on GitLab.

Last week, our team successfully created and passed all unit-test, ensuring the robustness of our code. The front-end development phase was completed, encompassing all the necessary functionalities for our webpage. We addressed and fixed minor bugs to enhance the user experience. Lastly, we redeployed the website on GitLab after changing all our URLs to use REACT_APP_API_HOST in our code.

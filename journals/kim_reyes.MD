Today, our team at NedyBytes underwent a project review with our instructor, Paul, after Jeff presented our wireframe design and our api endpoints. We received commendation for our progress and some feedback for minor improvements. Our team successfully identified and addressed issues in the code related to chat room and message creation where we have to change to endpoint path.

Our team was able to make the api endpoint for creating a user work. We had a multiple trial in Swagger UI that returned 200 code response.

Weekly sprint completed for this week. Started doing the backend authentication for logging in.

During the previous week, I was able to complete a backend code to get a cookie after logging the user in. We also established tables for cards, options, messages, and chat rooms. Additionally, we implemented endpoints for post card, post option, and view deck functionalities, all of which are secured by login authorization.

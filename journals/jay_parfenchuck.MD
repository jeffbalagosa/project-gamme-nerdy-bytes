Today, we underwent a comprehensive review of our MVP, wireframes, and model diagrams with Paul. His expert analysis yielded several constructive insights, regarding the optimization of our endpoints. We have taken his recommendations into consideration and intend to incorporate the "options" diagram he drew up for us. This integration will streamline the response mechanism within our card drill model, enhancing overall efficiency and user experience.

This week, our team successfully accomplished several key milestones in our project. We completed the development of the user table and the backend user endpoint, and we successfully deployed our application using Docker. Additionally, we implemented database migrations utilizing SQL processes within Docker.

While we initiated work on our authentication module, we were unable to complete it within this timeframe. We plan to prioritize this task starting Monday. The team has demonstrated exceptional dedication and efficiency, particularly through our adoption of mob programming techniques.

This experience has been immensely valuable, providing us with practical insights into the agile workflow methodologies commonly employed in professional settings. We are enthusiastic about the progress we have made and look forward to continuing our momentum in the coming week.

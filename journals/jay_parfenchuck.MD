Today, we underwent a comprehensive review of our MVP, wireframes, and model diagrams with Paul. His expert analysis yielded several constructive insights, regarding the optimization of our endpoints. We have taken his recommendations into consideration and intend to incorporate the "options" diagram he drew up for us. This integration will streamline the response mechanism within our card drill model, enhancing overall efficiency and user experience.

This week, our team successfully accomplished several key milestones in our project. We completed the development of the user table and the backend user endpoint, and we successfully deployed our application using Docker. Additionally, we implemented database migrations utilizing SQL processes within Docker.

While we initiated work on our authentication module, we were unable to complete it within this timeframe. We plan to prioritize this task starting Monday. The team has demonstrated exceptional dedication and efficiency, particularly through our adoption of mob programming techniques.

This experience has been immensely valuable, providing us with practical insights into the agile workflow methodologies commonly employed in professional settings. We are enthusiastic about the progress we have made and look forward to continuing our momentum in the coming week.

This week, our team has been concentrating on finalizing the development of our endpoints. Progress on the backend has been massive, and we are optimistic about completing it within this timeframe. We have successfully established the foundation framework for our login page and intend further it by integrating a high-quality animated GIF login feature, as suggested by Harold and Jeff.

However, I encountered a technical anomaly: a boolean I implemented for the card function is defaulting to true, despite being set to false in the SQL database. The cause of this discrepancy is not immediately clear, and further research is required to find this out.

Overall, our team is confident in the progress of our project. We remain committed to maintaining this momentum and look foward to finishing this soon with the end seeming closer in sight!

In the past week, our team made progress towards the completion of our backend endpoints for the FastAPI framework. We have a lot so that is a huge relief to have that finished soon . Additionally, we successfully implemented our Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes, a task accomplished through exemplary teamwork. Our efforts in establishing a functional unit testing framework have also borne fruit.

We initiated the development of the front-end segment of our project. Notably, we are in the process of designing an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly login page, alongside a profile page. Ready to start using hooks and use effects to with react and start getting this project moving foward.

Today is the day! Project was due tonight and honestly had a blast throughout this process. I was able to get the post card implemented as well as post options. I kind of ended up making the Options my baby of the project. I added a button to edit and delete. Delete instantly removes the option from the card and reloads the page so its seemless. I made a edit button that will navigate to another page to update the options via put request from the back end. All in all I struggled a lot the past week, but was able to pull through. The crunch time makes you really kick it into gear and pick up what you need to when it counts. Super pround of the nerdy-bytes team for everything that we were able to accomplish.

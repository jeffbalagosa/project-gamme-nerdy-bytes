### At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small

- Seeing how CI/CD works in the real world is pretty cool. One of my coworkers transitioned from IT Operations to DevOps he's told me what he does. Finally getting to see it in action is very cool.

### At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small

- Chaining multiple terminal commands brings back the feeling of doing scripting automation at my old job.
- Almost 20 years of troubleshooting desktop computers for C-Suite execs to senior software engineers and everything in between has translated pretty well to troubleshooting code. Managing an IT team for five years has helped me work in this group dynamic. I am grateful for my past experiences and great mentors over the years.

### At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small

- Computing is nothing short of magic if you think about it. It's incredible how humans figured out that simply adding electricity to sand (silicon) can change the world!

### At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small

- If you're troubleshooting someone else's code it's good to step through the code and see what's happening line by line. If you can't define something, follow it through until you do. Not really an "Aha!" moment, but yesterday was a good reminder of that.

- Our workflow wasn't Agile, Rosheen pointed out we were still using Mod 2 workflow.
  - Creating dev-named branches instead of feature-branches.
  - And not deleting branches after work done.
- Gratefully, we were able to correct course and prune invalid branches.

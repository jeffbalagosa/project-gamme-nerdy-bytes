  CRUD method we were using. We also showed the Shape of
  the input and the shape of the output. I worked on Update
  User and List Dates. We were getting it prepared for a
  presentation tomorrow.

  update. Committed and pushed by journal update.

Today, I was out:

- I had to take some time off because I had to take my wife to
  emergency and did not get home until 3 PM on Nov 15, 2023

## Nov 16, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Our first end-point which is the user sign up. We performed a
  mob programming session on this and got it working by the end
  of the class day. A merge request was made and Kim performed
  the merge request.

With the team we did a mob programming session on authorization
which Kim was working on and figured it out after some great
detective work!

Today, I grabbed issue 29 to create a backend for show a deck to
work over the break. I finished the end over the break but had some
trouble with getting the correct data to come up because I did not
want to change the model because I was afraid that it may affect
someone's code. Jeff explained everything to me so I changed the
code and there was a pipeline issue with linter that did not like
the import of Options into the code and it not being used so I fixed
it and my backend was merged.

## Nov 27, 2023

Today, I grabbed issue for creating an end point for updating a deck.
will try to be done with this today. hopefully. Also I need to fill out my
journal for merging today. Oh, I finished the end point and sent a merge
request at the end of the day.

## Nov 28, 2023

Today, we tried to checkout how to create a unit test for an end point
but it seemed a little complicated. Grabbed a new issue for create an
end point for list decks. Will try to finish it today by end of day. I
need to study for the practice test!

## Nov 29, 2023

Today, I worked on creating a date table. I completed it but for some
reason it came up in another branch so we just cancelled the merge for it.
Also completed end point for update a deck. Grabbed some work for update
a card.

## Nov 30, 2023

Today, I worked on creating an endpoint to update a card. While running
tests on my card I noticed that when a user was not logged in that we were
getting a 500 server error. I asked about that and the team wanted a better
error than 500 to fix the issue in the front end so I created an issue for it.
Also noticed that when we list all decks that the deck name was comming backend
as "0" and not the name of the deck. Also noticed that when the decks are listed
the card count was not updated. Created an issue for both of these as well.
Grabbed the issue to fix the missing deck name when we get all of the decks.

## Dec 01, 2023

Today, I finally finished fixing the issue with the deck name not coming out when
all decks are listed. Sent a merge request to Jay for that one, # 55-fix-get-all-decks-missing-deck-name.
Grabbed another issue to create an #49-end-point-for-list-dates. Finished list date end point.
Had some interesting issues that really openned my eyes! I was also having an issue with the
fact that we had not created an end point to enter in data into the table for me to checkout
this back-end. Jeff suggested I use SQL to put data into the table so I can run my test. I did not
know how to do that at all so I checked on line and altered some SQL on beekeeper and was able to
get some data in. Really Cool! I tried sending a merge request on this back-end #49 but am still
having trouble with git. I was behind by some commits but I was not seeing this on my screen. I really
took my time to navigate around to see if I can get the correct screen to view but I just could not see
it. Will talk to Jeff about it on Monday so I don't have to hunt around for the correct screen.

## Dec 04 2023

Today, I created an issue for creating a frontend sign up and I assigned it to myself. Still working
on it at the end of the day. Also did two merge requests for Kim and Jeff.

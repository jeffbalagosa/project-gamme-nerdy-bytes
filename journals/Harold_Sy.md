Today, I grabbed issue 29 to create a backend for show a deck to
work over the break. I finished the end over the break but had some
trouble with getting the correct data to come up because I did not
want to change the model because I was afraid that it may affect
someone's code. Jeff explained everything to me so I changed the
code and there was a pipeline issue with linter that did not like
the import of Options into the code and it not being used so I fixed
it and my backend was merged.
